"console.log('Hello World');"
Output: Hello world. This is the birth of a programmer. The moment when the first bit of code has been compiled. The moment the person says hello to the world of programming. Just like an infant, this is jsut the beginning. At this point, there is still pretty much everything to learn, but nothing to lose. There is bound to be many bugs, just like real life, but any bug can be fixed given enough time.
